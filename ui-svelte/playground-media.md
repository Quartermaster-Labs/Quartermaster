# ui-svelte — playground image & speech studios

`src/components/playground/`. The chat surface is in
[`playground-chat.md`](playground-chat.md).

## `ImageInterface.svelte`

Full SD image-gen UI: txt2img/img2img (`ImageGenMode`), denoise/hires (`enable_hr`), reference
images (`extra_images`, Kontext), per-model defaults, style presets, seed modes.

**Batch** (Settings → Batch, `sdapi batch_size` → sd.cpp `batch_count`, capped at `MAX_BATCH`):
N images per prompt, rendered sequentially with the seed incrementing per image — the step bar
therefore restarts per image (the in-flight row shows `×N`). Each turn keeps a **picked** image
index (numbered badge on the thumbnails, batch>1 only) that the reply/copy/download/upscale
actions act on.

**ESRGAN upscale** (`runUpscale` → `lib/imageApi.upscaleImage` → `POST /v1/images/upscale`):
⤢ button on any result-image action row AND on each composer attachment (hover); posts the 4×
result as a new turn. `toB64(img)` first — a saved image is a `/api/media/<hash>` URL, not a data
URL. Busy key `m<turn>`/`a<idx>` serializes runs to one at a time.

Pure helpers live beside it in `imageGen.ts`: `ASPECTS`/`SIZE_TIERS`/`aspectDims`,
`SAMPLER_OPTIONS`/`SCHEDULER_OPTIONS`, the `IMAGE_DEFAULTS` per-model preset table + `defaultsFor`,
`fmtDur`, and `parseSdProgress` — the sd-server stdout phase/step parser, spec'd in
`imageGen.test.ts`.

## `SpeechInterface.svelte`

The Speech studio.

**Voice cloning is gated on the server-declared `capabilities.voice_clone`**, not on "the voice
list contains `''`": a TTS.cpp model's cached list starts at `[""]` too, and its engine has no
clone route at all, so the old inference offered a Clone button that could only fail.

The voice list auto-fetches when the selected model **becomes** ready, not only when the selection
changes — picking an idle model used to seed `[""]` and never look again, leaving a fixed-voice-pack
engine looking voiceless until the user found ⟳.

Voice-list normalization (`lib/voices.ts`) is shared with chat read-aloud — see
[`playground-chat.md`](playground-chat.md) for the `safeVoice` / substitution-warning rules, which
apply to both surfaces.

## `MaskEditor.svelte`

Canvas brush painter producing a PNG mask data URL for sd-server inpainting.
